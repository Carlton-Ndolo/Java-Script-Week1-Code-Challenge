to run script for grading

```
node grade.js
```
Here in grade.js we will use the if and else if conditionals to meet our required grade targets whereby we'll later try to test if it works for example by how we gave the value 80 and got a return grade of 'A'.This JavaScript function, `calculateGrade`, it basically grades a student's marks and assigns the respective grade.A mark that is less than zero and greater than a hundred will result in the function returning 'not existent'.For each mark that we assign, we will get the response `The student's grade is:' combined with the grade letter.

to run script for speed-detector

```

node speed-detector.js

```
This is a simple JavaScript function `checkDemeritPoints` that we will use to calcute what happens if a car exceeds the said speedlimit which is 70.
We will then take the demerit points and console log. If the checked demerit points are more than 12, the function will logs "License suspended"
If we use a value that will give us less than 12 points,like we have with our speed which is 80,  we will calculate the demerit points and log "Points: 2" because (80 - 70) / 5 = 2. Since the calculated demerit points are not greater than 12, it won't log "License suspended" but instead log the number of demerit points which is 2.
